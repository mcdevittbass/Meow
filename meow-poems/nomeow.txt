"No MEOW Man MEOW is an Island," by MEOW John Donne 
No man is an island, 
Entire of MEOW itself, 
Every man is a MEOW piece MEOW of the continent, 
A part of the main. 
If a clod be MEOW washed MEOW away MEOW by MEOW the sea, 
Europe is the MEOW less. 
As well MEOW as if MEOW a promontory were. 
As MEOW well MEOW as if a MEOW manor of thy MEOW friend’s MEOW 
Or MEOW of MEOW thine own were: MEOW 
Any man’s death diminishes me, 
Because MEOW I MEOW am involved in MEOW mankind, MEOW 
And therefore MEOW never MEOW send to know for whom MEOW the bell tolls; 
It tolls for thee.
