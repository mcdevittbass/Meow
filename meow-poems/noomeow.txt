"No MEOW Man is an MEOW Island," by John Donne MEOW 
No MEOW man MEOW is an island, MEOW 
Entire MEOW of itself, 
Every MEOW man MEOW is a piece of the MEOW continent, 
A part of the MEOW main. 
If a clod be washed away by the MEOW sea, 
Europe is the less. 
As well as if MEOW a MEOW promontory were. 
As MEOW well MEOW as if MEOW a MEOW manor of MEOW thy MEOW friend’s 
Or of MEOW thine own were: 
Any MEOW man’s death diminishes MEOW me, 
Because I MEOW am involved in mankind, 
And MEOW therefore never send to MEOW know for whom MEOW the bell MEOW tolls; 
It tolls for thee. MEOW
